# sl-group-message-rug
For use inworld in Second Lifeâ“‡.  This script will scan the area at regular intervals as specified by the owner (in whole minutes) and reports the nearby avatars to the owner. 

## About
Detects collision with an avatar and sends a different message depending on whether the avatar has the same active group as the object the script is in

## Setup
- Create a prim
- Apply the included texture (or your own)
- Create a config notecard and modify the settings to your taste
- Drop the script and notecard into the prim
- Set to group

## Troubleshooting
Q. The rug is not showing my messages or reading the notecard.
A.  MAKE SURE you follow the directions in the notecard exactly. If you need to, try using a copy of your backup config notecard. DO NOT change the name of the config notecard. If you are sure you entered the info correctly in the notecard, try resetting the script in the rug. You can also try picking up and replacing the rug.

NOTE: The rug is not phantom and will NOT work if set to phantom.
